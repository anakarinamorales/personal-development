# Personal development - Marcus Lugg (cortadocodes)
## Overview
This repository documents my personal development as a Python programmer. It includes:
* Topics I've identified as important to study and practice
* Details of books I intend to read
* Details of courses I intend to take
* Proposed projects to hone my skills
* Best practices and useful commands I've found along the way (e.g. commit message formats or ideal package structures) 
* Open questions I have

Together, these form a plan and a measure of my progress; as such, the repository will be added to, changed and 
improved over time.
