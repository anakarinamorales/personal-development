# Personal development - Marcus Lugg (cortadocodes)
## Overview
This repository documents my personal development as a software engineer and Python programmer. It includes:
* [Topics I've identified as important](#topics-for-study) to study and practice
* Details of [books I intend to read](/#books-for-study)
* Details of [courses I intend to take](/#possible-courses)
* [Proposed projects](/#proposed-projects) to hone my skills
* [Best practices](/docs/best_practices) and [useful commands](/docs/useful_commands) I've found along the way (e.g. commit 
message formats or ideal package structures)
* Open questions I have

Together, these form a plan and a measure of my progress; as such, the repository will be added to, changed and 
improved over time.
