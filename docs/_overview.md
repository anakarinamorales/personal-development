# Personal development - Marcus Lugg (cortadocodes)
## Overview
This repository documents my personal development as a software engineer and Python programmer. It includes:
* [Topics](#topics-for-study) I've identified as important to study and practice
* Details of [books](#books-for-study) I intend to read
* Details of [courses](#possible-courses) I intend to take
* Proposed [projects](#proposed-projects) to hone my skills
* [Best practices](/docs/best_practices) and [useful commands](/docs/useful_commands) I've found along the way (e.g. commit 
message formats or ideal package structures)
* Open questions I have

Together, these form a plan and a measure of my progress; as such, the repository will be added to, changed and 
improved over time.
