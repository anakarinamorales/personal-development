# Personal development - Marcus Lugg (cortadocodes)
## Overview
This repository documents my personal development as a software engineer and Python programmer. It includes:
* [Projects](#proposed-projects) I've proposed to hone my skills
* [Topics](#topics-for-study) I've identified as important to study and practice
* [Courses](#possible-courses) I plan to take
* [Books](#books-for-study) I intend to read
* [Certifications](#certifications-qualifications-and-achievements) I gain as I work through my plan
* [Best practices](/docs/best_practices) and [useful commands/information](/docs/useful_commands_and_info) I've found along the way (e.g. commit message formats or ideal package structures)
* [Questions](/docs/questions.md) I currently have

Together, these form a plan and a measure of my progress; as such, this repository will be added to, changed and 
improved over time.
