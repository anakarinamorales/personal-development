# personal-development
This repository is the one-stop location for all matters related to my 
personal development as a Python programmer. This includes my overall plan, 
broad and narrow checklists of topics and subjects I need to become familiar 
with, and a wiki of best-practices for any given processes (e.g. commit 
message formats or ideal package structures) I come across. It will be added
to and changed over time as I progress.
