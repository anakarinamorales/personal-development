# Bash
I currently have a good grasp of bash and can use it to do most things I want, however I am unfamiliar with it as a 
language on the whole. I want to be able to easily write a rigorous script in bash without having to look up 
the particulars of bash syntax and methodology. To that end, I want to formally learn about the topics below.
