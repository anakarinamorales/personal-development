# Bash
I currently have a good grasp of bash and can use it to do most things I want, however I am unfamiliar with it as a 
language on the whole. I want to be able to easily write a rigorous script in bash without having to look up 
the particulars of bash syntax and methodology. To that end, I want to formally learn about the topics below.   

## Topics for study:
* `if else` statements
* Piping outputs of commands to other commands
* Proper use of `grep`
* Reading in user input
* The intricacies of bash and shell variables
* File and directory manipulation (e.g. checking if a directory exists, using the `find` command)
