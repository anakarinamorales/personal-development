# Bash
I currently have a good grasp of bash and can use it to do most things I want, however I am unfamiliar with it as a 
language on the whole. I want to be able to easily write a rigorous script in bash without having to look up 
the particulars of bash syntax and methodology. To that end, I want to formally learn about the topics below.   

## Topics for study:
* `if else` and `case` statements
* Booleans
* Comparing different variable types (e.g. less than, more than, equal to)
* `for` loops
* Piping outputs of commands to other commands
    * Difference between `>` and `>>`
* Proper use of `grep`
* Reading in user input
* The intricacies of bash and shell variables
* File and directory manipulation (e.g. checking if a directory exists, using the `find` command)
* Functions
    * Positional arguments
    * Optional arguments
* Aliases
* Multi-line string inputs
* Use of `chmod`
* Arguments and flags for `echo`, `read`, `export`
* `printf` vs `echo`
* Tests in bash

Some places to start:
* [Writing shell scripts](https://medium.com/tech-tajawal/writing-shell-scripts-the-beginners-guide-4778e2c4f609)
* [Shebangs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_%28Unix%29)
