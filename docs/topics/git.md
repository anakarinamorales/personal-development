## Courses:
* [Udacity: How to use Git and GitHub](https://eu.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775)

## Books:
* The official ["Pro Git" book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/)

## Practice
See my [git-practice](https://github.com/cortadocodes/git-practice/tree/master/) repo, where I generate some 
reproducible sample git history that can be safely and transparently experimented on with potentially destructive 
git actions, such as interactive rebasing and squashing. My reflections from the Udacity course are also located in 
this repo.
