# Git

## Topics for study:
* Local basics (`init`, `log`, `add`, `commit`, `diff`, `status`, `checkout`, `branch`, `merge`, merge conflicts)
* Configuring and inspecting remotes (`remote add`, `remote rm`, `remote rename`, `remote show`)
* Using remotes (`push`, `pull`, `fetch`, `clone`)
* Github (forking, pull requests, general collaboration)
* Force pushing and pulling
* Resets (soft and hard)
* Rebasing
* Squashing
* Sub-modules
* `git stash`
* Manipulating git history
* The meaning of `^` and `~` in relation to `HEAD`
* Tags/releases

## Courses:
* [Udacity: How to use Git and GitHub](https://eu.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775)

## Other resources:
* The official ["Pro Git" book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/)

## Practice
See my [git-practice](https://github.com/cortadocodes/git-practice/tree/master/) repo, where I generate some simple 
reproducable sample git history so that I can safely and transparently play around with some potentially destructive 
git actions, such as interactive rebasing and squashing. My reflections from the Udacity course are also located in 
this repo.
