# PostgreSQL

I understand basic SQL and have completed some simple courses on Codecademy, but the implementation of SQL databases 
has so far confused me. To address this, I intend to become much more familiar with one of the main flavours of SQL - 
PostgreSQL. I'll also cover SQL commands in more detail.
