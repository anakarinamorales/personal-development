# PyCharm

PyCharm is an excellent IDE and my number one choice for developing in Python. It brings together all the benefits of
a good text editor (syntax highlighting, linting etc.) with interactive debugging (a definite time-saver), automated 
local testing as-you-type, integration of remote machines, and advanced refactoring tools (such as renaming a 
variable or function across all files in a project in one click). This barely scrapes the surface, however, and I want 
to learn more about the following things to become a more efficient engineer:
* Automated testing
* Advanced refactoring
* Git and GitHub integration
* Remote debugging
* Profiling and coverage
* Scientific mode
* Creating and syncing keymap repositories compatible with multiple development environments
