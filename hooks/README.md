# Git hooks
The hooks in this directory should be copied to `.git/hooks/` after the repository (`personal-development`) is cloned. 
After this, they can be edited from the `personal-development/hooks` directory as they will be copied to `
.git/hooks` before each commit. Note that changes to the hooks won't have effect until they are run again.
